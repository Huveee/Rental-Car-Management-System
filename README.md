## Project Summary

A car rental project is a project that allows users to rent cars online. The purpose of this project is to provide an easy and efficient way for users to search for, reserve, and rent cars from rental company. The program typically involves creating a user-friendly interface, and connecting to files of rental cars and availability.

In this project, users should be able to register and create an account, as well as log in to the system with their email and password. Also, when needed they can manage their accounts, including viewing reservation history and disabling accounts.
To make a reservation for a rental car, they search for available rental cars by location, date, and type of car. And then by selecting a car, entering the rental dates, and providing payment information they complete the car rental process.

Managers should be able to manage the inventory of rental cars, including adding new cars, updating information about existing cars, and removing cars from the system.

The system should check the availability of rental cars and prevent double bookings or overbooking.
